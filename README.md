# csc370_rock_paper_scissors

Created a tournament amongst bots playing rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock. The goal was to design a bot with the best approach to playing the game. We based our bot around the Markov Chain model, predicting the opponent's next move based on how they usually respond to the bot's previous move and the opponent's previous move. The bot ended up working very well against other simple bots and other bots designed by students in the class.
